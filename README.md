# AdonisJS GraphQL API Start Project
A boilerplate for Node.js web applications, project with opinionated architecture that is used as the basis for new projects.
This is the boilerplate for creating an API server in AdonisJ with GraphQL.

# Motivation
When we start a new api GraphQL with NODEJS is hard to organize the code (mutation, resolvers, schemas) to have a scalable and maintainable architecture, like with MVC or DDD pattern where we are mature. I read a medium posts , books, and GraphQl concept to understand the goal and the best way to structure a GraphQL api, i searched the boilerplate which respect the architecture in this [article](https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/).

After days searching the best architecture, i found many good architecture for NODEJS and GraphQL, but i was not convinced, well i decided do it, with the best parts of each architecture which i saw, and my opinions and skills ðŸ¥‡ ðŸ˜Ž.
